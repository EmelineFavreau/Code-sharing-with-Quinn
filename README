Exploring bioinformatics languages with MSci student Quinn:
- in bash: checking-quota-on-cluster.txt, testing-exonerate-on-cluster.txt, testing-exonerate-whatidid.txt, testing-exonerate.sh
- in R: plotting-data-from-internet.Rmd 

What we've learnt:
- checking that the input file is as expected (e.g. head input/my.fasta)
- extension .gz refers to compressed data, sometimes needs to be uncompressed
