# Script for Quinn, due on Friday 


# Aim: checking my quota on the cluster

# using the command line quota, with the options v and s
# then piping the command line head
quota -v -s | head

# here is the output
# Disk quotas for user efavreau (uid 13591): 
#     Filesystem   space   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace

# checking my quota for the directory VespaCrabro
# using the command line quota, with the options v and s
# then piping the command line grep with the option A and 2
quota -v -s | grep -A 2 "VespaCrabro"


# here is the output
#     128.41.96.8:/slms/gee/research/ugi/VespaCrabro
#                 27821M      0K   5120G            624k       0   1000k     

# This means that on the cluster I have
# space 27821M
# quota 0K
# limit 5120G
# files 624k
# limit 1000k

# Conclusion: I have enough space (27821M out of 5120G) and 
# I have not run out of number of files allowed 
# (I have 624k files out of 1000k).

# Research notes

# quota https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/quota.1.html
# here I ask for verbose (-v) which means gives lots of details
# and I ask for -s which makes all numbers human readable

# head https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/head.1.html


# grep https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html
# here I ask for Context Line Control (-A) where it prints 2 lines after matching

# units used in file sizes
