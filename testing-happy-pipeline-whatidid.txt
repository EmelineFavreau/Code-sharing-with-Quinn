# The pipeline is using conda, so the first step is to activate the environment
conda activate happy

# The pipeline is set to use python 3.9, which currently throws several syntax warnings
# warnings are not errors, so the pipeline is still running

# Here we test the pipeline
# we want to find the ORs of Vespa crabro by using Polistes canadensis as a reference
# focus genome: Vespa crabro (PacBio genome) 
# reference annotation: Polistes canadensis (from Legan et al 2020)
# reference genome: Polistes canadensis (fragmented genome) GCF_001313835.1_ASM131383v1
# cutoff to 0.45 (same as for ants, this might be changed)
